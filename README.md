# MLAssignment1AHMAHM007

Handwritten Digit Classification using Feedforward Neural Networks


The neural network is implemented in Python using PyTorch and Torchvision libraries.


The project consists of the following files:


AHMAHM007.ipynb: Implemendation of Data Preprocessing, Feedforward Neural Network and Model Evaluation.


classifier.py: This file contains the main script for training the neural network, evaluating its performance, and interactive classification of handwritten digit images.


mnist_model.pth: This file contains the trained model weights saved after training the neural network.


log.txt: This text file contains the training loss after each epoch and the final accuracy on the test set obtained during a previous training run of the model.
